There are a few ways to install Osgood.

## Download a Prebuilt Release

First, visit the [Releases](https://github.com/IntrinsicLabs/osgood/releases)
page. There you will find different builds available for two of the two major
platforms. From there you can download a binary and run it.

- [Osgood for MacOS](TODO)
- [Osgood for Linux](TODO)

## npm

As a matter of convenience, you can also install Osgood using npm. This will
put the `osgood` binary somewhere in your path automatically. You can do so by
running the following:

```shell
npm install -g osgood
```

## Build from Scratch

The third method is to [build](Building) the project and run the binary you
compile locally.

Osgood runs your JavaScript code using the V8 engine and therefore provides
fairly modern features. For example, the following are available:

- `async` functions / `await` keyword
- `class` syntax and private fields
- `BigInt`
- destructuring assignments
- `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`
- `const`, `let` declarations
- arrow functions
- default parameters
- property shorthands
- regular expression named capture groups

JavaScript is interesting because there are many features which aren't
technically part of the core language. Popular functions like `alert()`,
`setTimeout()`, `atob()`, and `fetch()` are examples. They are instead features
added by various implementations (such as browsers).

We specifically chose to provide features beneficial to server side JavaScript
applicationsâ€”features that are based on existing implementations available in
other JavaScript environments.

We provide many globals which are commonly used in other JavaScript runtimes.
Here's a list of them:

### Generic Features

- `console.{log,error,warn,info,debug,trace}`
- `setTimeout` / `setInterval` / `clearTimeout` / `clearInterval`
- `atob` / `btoa`
- `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, `TransformStream`
- `TextEncoder`, `TextDecoder`
- `URL`, `URLSearchParams`

### Fetch API

Instead of building an interface for making requests from scratch we chose to
implement the familiar `fetch()` interface provided by browsers. These classes
and functions all revolve around the [Fetch
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
